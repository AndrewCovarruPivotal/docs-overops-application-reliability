## <a id='overview'></a>Overview
OverOps is a root-cause identification and analysis application for applications in staging and production phases. It automatically detects the main causes of errors without depending on logging.

The solution can also be seamlessly integrated into a teamâ€™s workflow. This is enabled by the multiple integration methods provided by OverOps, for teams to be able to continue utilizing existing tools and services, such as communication channels.

Because of that, OverOps is able to instantly alert the right developer in code breaking instances instead of everyone or the wrong person on the team being deployed. This is automatically performed, so reparative tasks are completed in a short span of time. The same thing is also done whenever a known error resurfaces.
